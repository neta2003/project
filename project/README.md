PROJECT
Description:
PROJECT is a Python-based project designed to manage, clean, and analyze patient data for epilepsy research. It provides tools for filtering irrelevant data, conducting detailed analyses, and generating visualizations to help researchers better understand the data and draw conclusions.
Features:
Data Cleaning: Remove irrelevant rows and handle missing or inconsistent data efficiently.
Data Analysis: Perform comprehensive analyses to address research questions about epilepsy.
Data Visualization: Generate informative visualizations to simplify complex data trends.
